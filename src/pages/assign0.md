## Assignment 0 ‚Äì Web Programming Adventure ‚úàÔ∏è

- **Points:** 60
- **Due:** Friday, October 4 at 5:00pm

Welcome to the first assignment for [CS 253: Web Security](https://cs253.stanford.edu). ‚ú®

For this assignment, you're going to be completing several command-line workshops to ensure you're up-to-speed on the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and Node.js. The HTML and JavaScript material should be review from [CS 142](https://cs142.stanford.edu), while the Node.js material may be a more bit challenging.

## Prepare

### Install Node.js and `npm`

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), a popular JavaScript runtime. Choose Node.js 12.

Node.js is a program that you install on your computer. With Node.js you can use the very popular programming language JavaScript to write software. JavaScript is usually used in a browser like Chrome or Firefox but with Node.js it is possible to do a lot more. Combined with other tools, Node.js allows you to write Desktop applications like Word or iTunes, Server applications like Apache, Network applications like Curl or even mobile applications for the iPhone or Android.

Confirm that Node.js was installed. Open your terminal and run this command:

```sh
node --version
```

Node.js comes bundled with `npm`, a package manager for installing Node.js packages.

Confirm that it was installed:

```sh
npm --version
```

If you have trouble getting Node.js installed, please come to office hours or [post in Piazza](https://piazza.com/stanford/fall2019/cs253).

### Get the starter code

Run this command to clone the code with `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stanford-web-security/assign0.git
```

Enter the folder you just created:

```sh
cd assign0
```

Install the necessary local dependencies with `npm`:

```sh
npm install
```

Install the workshops you will be completing globally with this command:

```sh
npm install -g learnyouhtml javascripting learnyounode
```

The `-g` option installs these packages globally so that you can run them as a command in your terminal. After running this command, you'll have three new programs you can run from your terminal: `learnyouhtml`, `javascripting`, and `learnyounode`. We installed them this way so they would be easier to run since you're going to be running these commands a lot for this assignment.

If the command fails with a permissions error, you likely do not have permission to modify the `/usr/local` system folder. The easiest fix is to rerun the above command with `sudo` prepended.

To remove the global packages when you're finished with the assignment, just run:

```sh
npm rm -g learnyouhtml javascripting learnyounode
```

(If you'd prefer to avoid global installation, you can download and run these commands on a one-off basis with e.g. `npx learnyouhtml` instead.)

### Use StandardJS code style

All the code you write for CS 253 must pass the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) linter. StandardJS enforces code quality, consistency, and catches several types of programmer errors.

You can check your code by running:

```sh
npm run lint
```

If no errors are printed by this command then no code style errors or programmer errors were detected.

If you have errors, **you can automatically fix them** most of the time by running:

```sh
npm run lint-fix
```

Now, let's start the assignment. I hope you're ready! üòÅ

## Part 1 ‚Äì Learn You The HTML For Much Win! (11 points, 1 per exercise)

Run the following command:

```sh
learnyouhtml
```

You'll see the menu:

![](../static/learnyouhtml.png)

Navigate the menu with the up & down arrow keys. Choose a challenge by hitting enter.

Whenever an exercise tells you to create a file, you should use the files we've already created for you in the `src/` folder. For example, the first file you need to edit is `src/learnyouhtml/index.html`.

**IMPORTANT: Use a separate file for each exercise!** We have provided you with a separate file to use for each exercise.

You can use any text editor you like to, whether it's `vim` or `emacs` or even a visual editor like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Complete all the exercises. There are 11 in total.

It's easiest if you switch into the `src/learnyouhtml` folder and do your work in there. Here's an example:

```sh
cd src/learnyouhtml
learnyouhtml # select an exercise to complete
vim index.html # edit the file in your editor of choice
learnyouhtml verify index.html # check that you did it correctly!
```

If you get stuck, the web is your friend! You can quickly search for a topic and quickly refresh your memory. A good trick is to search for a concept along with the abbreviation `"mdn"`, short for [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) which is the best web resource for HTML and JavaScript APIs. So, for example if you want a refresher on how `<script>` tags work, you could search for `"script mdn"`.

When you're finished with all the exercises, your `src/learnyouhtml` folder should have 11 complete `.html` files. Nice work!

When you're ready, go on to the next part.

## Part 2 ‚Äì JavaScripting Adventure! (20 points, 1 per exercise)

Run the following command:

```sh
javascripting
```

You'll see the menu:

![](../static/javascripting.png)

Complete all the exercises. There are 20 in total.

It's easiest if you switch into the `src/javascripting` folder and do your work in there. Here's an example:

```sh
cd src/javascripting
javascripting # select an exercise to complete
vim introduction.js # edit the first file in your editor of choice
javascripting verify introduction.js # check that you did it correctly!
```

When you're finished with all the exercises, go on to the next part.

## Part 3 ‚Äì Learn You The Node.js For Much Win! (26 points, 2 per exercise)

Run the following command:

```sh
learnyounode
```

You'll see the menu:

![](../static/learnyounode.png)

Complete all the exercises. There are 13 in total.

Unlike Part 1 and Part 2, this part is likely to contain new material that you might not be familiar with. It is expected that you'll read the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/index.html), do web searches, and come to office hours if you're stuck. In the real world, programmers often have to learn topics quickly in a just-in-time manner to solve problems they encounter. This is good practice! If you get stuck, come to office hours or [post in Piazza](https://piazza.com/stanford/fall2019/cs253).

It's easiest if you switch into the `src/learnyounode` folder and do your work in there. Here's an example:

```sh
cd src/learnyounode
learnyounode # select an exercise to complete
vim hello-world.js # edit the first file in your editor of choice
learnyounode verify hello-world.js # check that you did it correctly!
```

When you're finished with all the exercises, go on to the next part.

## Part 4 ‚Äì Survey (3 points)

Your feedback matters a lot! This is a brand new course, so please help us improve by answering the survey questions in `src/SURVEY.md`. As a reward, enjoy some easy points!

## Submit

### Before you submit

Ensure that the sanity tests pass:

```sh
npm test
```

This command just runs a basic sanity test that ensures your project passes `npm run lint`, has the right folder structure, and doesn't have any blank required files. If `npm test` doesn't report any errors that doesn't necessarily mean that you've solved every exercise perfectly!

**üåü PRO TIP: You can automatically fix most lint errors by running:**

```sh
npm run lint-fix
```

### Gradescope

We use [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com) for submissions. Enroll with the code `97BGZB`.

### The moment of truth

When you're ready to submit your work, you'll upload the `src/` folder to Gradescope.

You should submit early and often! There's no downside to repeatedly submitting your assignment.
